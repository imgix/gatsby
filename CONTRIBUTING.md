## Project Goals

- Well-tested and high quality code.
- The public API should be handled with care because a) once an API is submitted, we are committed to supporting it for a reasonable amount of time, and b) any changes to the API creates exponentially more work for the users of our libraries.

## Using the issue tracker

The issue tracker is the preferred channel for [bug reports](#bugs),
[features requests](#features), questions, and [submitting pull
requests](#pull-requests), but please respect the following restrictions:

- Please **do not** derail or troll issues. Keep the discussion on topic and respect the opinions of others.

## Development

The development of this library follows standard TDD practices. You can run the tests in TDD mode with `yarn tdd` from the root.

## Publishing

1. Bump the version in packages/gatsby-transform-url/src/index.ts and commit.
2. Run `yarn run-publish` from root.

Publish stable versions from main, and prerelease versions from beta.

## Code Conventions

1.  Make all changes to files under `./src`, **not** `./dist` or `./es`.
2.  Use [Prettier](https://prettier.io/) for code formatting. Code will automatically be formatted upon submitting a PR.
3.  Every commit must follow the [conventional commit specification](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0-beta.2/).

## Project setup

1. Run `yarn` to install dependencies
2. Add a .env file to the root of the project with the contents from "Gatsby .env file" in 1Password.
